You search to find a painting of a forest. You remove the painting and find a safe and noticed a code some moron left on the back of the painting.

Then, out of nowhere, a stack of 10 gold bars awaits you as you open the door. You pick them up and take it with you, then leave the mansion with a smile of your face.

good ending
