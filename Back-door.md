## *The back.......DUN DUN DUUUUUUNNNNNN*

You head around to the back of the mansion.
The mansions back is filled with grass beyond belif and the walls of the house are covered in vines. further back there is a willow tree upon a lone hill.


You look around for a bit and find a small door that leads to a branching hallway. Which way do you take?
