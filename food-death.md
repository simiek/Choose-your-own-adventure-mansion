## Food so good. so 'chomp' moldy

you took one bite of the food and discovered that the food tasted amazing... ... ... or at least thats what you hoped

after taking one bite of the food you notice its terribly moldy on the bottem. it seems to have been preseved in a decorative solution to make it look edible

soon after you start to heavily cough. you start to cough out blood as well, probably because it was poisened. you fall on the floor about to die 

your final words were "it was worth it"

you shouldent have been fat today im guessing?
