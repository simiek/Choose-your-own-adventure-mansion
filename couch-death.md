As you look around, you have not found anything interesting.

Then, out of curiousity, you get bored, and decide to sit down 

a nice-looking couch. As you sit, you feel something 

chomping your leg off, tearing it apart. As you look down,

you realize that the couch you're sitting on eats you up and

you can't escape.
