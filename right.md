## Where am I? ... so hungry ... ......


you enter the right path and walk for awhile

you walk even more

you walk much more

After awhile of walking you decide that you should go back

after about 2 seconds of going back you smack your face in a wall and fall down

once you get your barings from the sudden face-wall you begin to panic in fear and start to hyper ventilate. along with this you keep banging the indestructable wall. you think and pray tha maybe you made a wrong turn and didnt relize it


you run for a straight 30 minnutes down the chorridor and then stoped to catch your breath

when looking back to where you came you noticed the wall.

hours passsed

days too

your insanity had killed you

fear the endless truth

you died a horrible death of starvation and insanity
